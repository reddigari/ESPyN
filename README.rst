----

This library uses the (private and wholly undocumented) ESPN Fantasy Football
API to retrieve data about **public** leagues. It includes object models of
leagues, teams, players, and stat lines (at the player-week and team-week
levels).

Basic Usage
-----------

Use the ``League`` object to retrieve and interact with a fantasy league.
It needs the league ID, which is visible in the URL when viewing
the league on the ESPN website.

>>> from espyn import League
>>> league = League(1603206, season=2020)
>>> print(league)
ESPN League 1603206 - The Ocho, Dos - 10 teams
>>> print("Average weekly score", league.average_score())
Average weekly score: 94.19874999999999


Inspect teams through the ``.teams`` attribute, or the ``.get_team_by_id()`` method.

>>> team = league.get_team_by_id(7)
>>> print(team)
Team 7 : Samir Reddigari : Le'Veon On A Prayer : 3-9-0
>>> print("Points for:", team.points_for)
Points for: 850.6
>>> print("Points against:", team.points_against)
Points against: 1165.3000000000002


(My team had a rough 2020.)

The API request made when the ``League`` instance is created contains scores from
every matchup for the season.

>>> matchup = league.get_matchup(number=1, team_id=7)
>>> print(matchup)
Matchup #1 : Team Lupinacci (89.8)âœ… @ Le'Veon On A Prayer (74.3)
>>> print("Boxscore loaded:", matchup.boxscore_loaded)
Boxscore loaded: False


Boxscores for individual weeks can be loaded by setting the ``boxscore``
parameter. This will require another API request, and will include information
about each team's roster and player stats.


>>> matchup = league.get_matchup(number=1, team_id=7, boxscore=True)
>>> print("Boxscore loaded:", matchup.boxscore_loaded)
Boxscore loaded: True
>>> print(matchup.home_data)
[Scoring Period 1 : 74.3 points]
>>> for slot in matchup.home_data[0].slots:
...     if slot.slot not in ("BENCH", "INJURED"):
...         print(slot)
WR : Michael Thomas, WR, NO : 1.7 points
RB : Ezekiel Elliott, RB, DAL : 24.7 points
RB : Le'Veon Bell, RB, KC : 4.6 points
WR : Cooper Kupp, WR, LAR : 4.0 points
QB : Drew Brees, QB, NO : 14.4 points
FLEX : Raheem Mostert, RB, SF : 21.1 points
K : Justin Tucker, K, BAL : 9.0 points
TE : Hayden Hurst, TE, ATL : 3.8 points
D/ST : Vikings D/ST, D/ST, MIN : -9.0 points


Note that ``Matchup.home_data`` is a list; many ESPN leagues use multi-week
matchups during the playoffs. In this case, the list will contain
multiple ``TeamWeek`` instances. ESPN refers to each NFL week as a "scoring period."
A matchup contains one or more scoring periods. Use the
``League.matchup_num_to_scoring_periods()`` method to inspect the mapping.

Caching
-------

Retrieving each scoring period's boxscore requires a separate API request. (It's
possible this is untrue, and I have not tinkered with the API endpoint sufficiently.)
Caching the responses is recommended:

.. code-block:: Python

   from espyn import League
   from espyn.caches import LocalCache

   cache = LocalCache("/path/to/cache/directory")
   league = League(<LEAGUE_ID>, <SEASON>, cache)

The responses from all API calls will be cached as JSON files in the specified
directory, and neither the constructor nor methods with ``boxscore=True`` will
make network requests if the necessary file is in the cache.
